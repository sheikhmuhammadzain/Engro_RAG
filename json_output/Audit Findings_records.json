Site shared that this was acceptable via current practices as the firewater pumps are not being used, despite excess capacity of the F/W main being used. The risk is that the additional hydraulic constraint on the system reduces the maximum attainable flow through the firewater system. In the event of a fire scenario, it is unlikely that process water use will be stopped as priority will be on emergency response. However, the maximum use case may not be possible, impacting firefighting effectiveness and exacerbating the loss. | Finding Location: Process - UTY and PP | Worst Case Consequence: C2 - Serious"

Hose should be handled with care. All hoses shall be installed per the manufacturer's installation recommendations for bend radius; bending beyond the minimum bend radius will reduce the hose life. 2. If the hose is kinked during installation, discard immediately. 3. Hose assemblies shall not be installed or operated in a twisted or torqued condition. Swivel fittings may be used in the layout design to aid in torque free installation. 4. Hoses are designed for single plane of flexibility only. Flex in multiple planes at the same time can reduce the service life of the hose and cause failures. 5. Verify hose has sufficient slack to allow for slight change in length on pressurizing or cooling. 6. Verify hose is not in direct contact with hot surfaces. 7. Hose should be run straight out of a fitting junction and should not be bent sharply into a junction. 8. For hoses in pressurized systems, the risk of hose whipping exists if the fittings become disconnected; consider the use of guards and restraints to mitigate the risks. 9. Avoid pulling hoses over or along sharp objects and scuffing over rough floors. 10. Where multiple hoses are connected, hoses should feature a safety cable to reduce whipping. 11. Where Cam Locks are supplied as the desired hose fitting, the arms shall be locked down by means of secondary securing. Storage: 1. Prior to storage, each hose shall be free of water, debris, metal shavings, dirt, or any other foreign material that may cause problems to the application. Air or nitrogen may be blown through the assembly to remove any loose particles. 2. All hoses shall be stored in such a manner to protect them from degrading factors such as humidity or moisture, temperature extremes, direct sunlight, corrosive liquids, or any other degrading atmosphere. 3. Hoses shall be stored hanging with open ends free to drain any excess water or debris. Do not hang hoses such that the maximum design bend radius is exceeded. 4. Care should be taken if hoses are stacked, as their weight can crush hoses at the bottom of the stack and stacks can become unstable, creating a safety hazard. 5. If stored below freezing, pre-warming may be required prior to handling, testing, and placing into service. Ideal temperature for hose storage is 50°F to 70°F (10°C to 20°C). 6.
